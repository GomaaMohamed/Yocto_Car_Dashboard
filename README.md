## Overview

In this project, We have developed a car dashboard application using Qt/QML for the frontend and C++ for the backend. The application communicates with various vehicle components using vsomeip, which provides interprocess communication capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Yocto Project Requirements](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html)

To get started with deploying the car dashboard application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository with all included layers:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/Yocto_Car_Dashboard.git
2. Open a terminal inside poky
3. Start building (It will take several hours according to your network and machine)
   
   ```bash
   source oe-init-build-env ../qemu-build
   bitbake my-custom-image

## Running on QEMU

To run the generated image on qemu, follow these steps:

1. Inside the same terminal enter this command:

   ```bash
   runqemu
